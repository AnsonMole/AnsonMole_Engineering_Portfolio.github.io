<h1>Production Composite Cure Oven (BAO3000)</h1>
<p><strong>Aerospace Manufacturing & Thermal Systems | Co-op Project</strong></p>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
Designed and supported the development of a large-scale production oven intended for
final curing of bonded composite aircraft structures. The system was required to meet
AMS2750 Class 2 Type D furnace requirements and support repeatable, production-level
composite cure cycles.
</p>

---

<h2>My Role</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Mechanical and systems engineering support across design, analysis, and integration</li>
    <li>Worked under AMS2750 requirements and internal aerospace manufacturing standards</li>
    <li>Collaborated with manufacturing, controls, and test personnel</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>System Requirements</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Certified as an AMS2750 Class 2 Type D furnace (±10°F tolerance)</li>
    <li>Capable of curing large bonded composite aircraft assemblies</li>
    <li>Uniform airflow and thermal distribution across working volume</li>
    <li>Closed-loop temperature control with over-temperature protection</li>
</ul>

---

<h2>Mechanical & Thermal Design</h2>

<h3>Oven Structure</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Modular insulated wall panel construction using steel framing and rigid insulation</li>
    <li>Large access door with gasketed sealing and safety interlocks</li>
    <li>Designed for manufacturability and maintenance access</li>
</ul>

<h3>Heating & Airflow</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Dual resistive electric heating units supplying controlled thermal energy</li>
    <li>Supply air distributed through internal ducting trunks and louvered registers</li>
    <li>Return air drawn from central regions to promote uniform circulation</li>
    <li>Airflow tuning achieved through blast gates and dampers</li>
</ul>

<p>
Thermal flow analysis and physical airflow tuning were used to minimize hot and cold
regions within the working volume.
</p>

<h2>Controls & Instrumentation</h2>

<h3>Temperature Sensing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Extensive network of K-type thermocouples distributed throughout the oven volume</li>
    <li>Separate sensing strategies for oven control and part temperature verification</li>
</ul>

<h3>Closed-Loop Control</h3>
<ul>
    <li>PID-based temperature control using real-time thermocouple feedback</li>
    <li>Weighted temperature averaging used to reduce sensitivity to outliers</li>
    <li>Silicon Controlled Rectifiers (SCRs) enabled continuously variable heater power</li>
    <li>Hard over-temperature protection implemented per AMS2750 requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>
Replacing discrete contactor-based heating control with SCRs allowed smoother ramp rates,
reduced thermal overshoot, and improved heater reliability during long cure cycles.
</p>

---

<h2>Certification & Testing</h2>
<p>
The oven was designed to pass all required AMS2750 certification testing, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Temperature Uniformity Surveys (TUS)</li>
    <li>System Accuracy Tests (SAT)</li>
    <li>Thermocouple calibration and instrumentation verification</li>
</ul>

<p>
Testing procedures ensured compliance across ramp, dwell, and stabilization phases
required for production composite curing.
</p>

---

<h2>Results & Impact</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Achieved production-capable composite curing at a fraction of commercial system cost</li>
    <li>Enabled in-house curing of large bonded aircraft structures</li>
    <li>Met stringent aerospace thermal uniformity and control requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>
The final system cost was orders of magnitude lower than comparable commercial alternatives
while meeting the same certification standards.
</p>

<h2>Engineering Judgment & Lessons Learned</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Airflow control was as critical as heater power for thermal uniformity</li>
    <li>SCR-based control significantly improved temperature stability and system longevity</li>
    <li>Designing for calibration, testing, and maintenance is essential for certified systems</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools & Skills Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Thermal systems engineering</li>
    <li>Mechanical design and assembly planning</li>
    <li>PID control concepts</li>
    <li>Industrial electrical and instrumentation systems</li>
    <li>Aerospace manufacturing standards (AMS2750)</li>
</ul>
